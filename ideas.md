Kind of like adopt me
  you get an egg
  you have to hatch it
  hatches into random pet
  you have to bring it to school
  take it to hospital
  give it food
  levels
    at adult level you get a new egg
  you get money while you raise it
    but expensive eggs
Like above idea
  when it's an adult
  furnite that doubles pet
little platformer where you have a pet that is in danger of falling or being crushed
little plant being attacked by ants/bugs
  you have a sword to protect it
tons of pets trying to eat eachother
  you have to keep them all alive
  pets
    cat
    bird
    dog
    fish
    snake
    turtle
  if they get near eachother they hurt eachother
  you have to feed them too
tower defense
  you have a critter that you must feed
  when you kill things with your tower you they drop food
  feed it to your thing
  thing gets bigger and bigger
    explodes or falls asleep
  if you feed it bad food, he dies
  if creatures get to end of trail, they attack your critter

Run animal daycare
  customers drop off animals
  animals have needs
    clean - animals poop randomly
      if animal bumps into poop, it auto gets sick indicator
      to clean, you have hose
        spray poop and it goes bye bye
    food - bring food to animal
      food is animal specific
    sick - if animal is sick
      bring it medicine
    sleep - bring animal to bed
  animal stays for a certain amount
    when animal is dropped off, owner says "Here's fido!"
    when owner comes back, she says "Bring me fido please!"
      if you give back wrong pet, it explodes
      if you give back right animal, you get cash
  you have to pay rent every 2 minutes
  Taking food/medicine costs money
